# BCA-Cafe-Bill-System



Welcome To My first Core C project 
        In this project, we include 3 package files {'stdio.h', 'string.h', 'stdlib.h', 'conio.h'}
here I use struct, function, array, FILE *fp for the .dat file name and save the bill there only in the name case 
I use conditional loops and switch case 
This is the my only that project which were make in core C language 
Thanks
